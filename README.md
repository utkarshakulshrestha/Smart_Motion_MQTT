# Smart_Motion_MQTT
In this project, we used Node-MCU and Arduino UNO as master and slave controllers to control the UNO over WiFi usign MQTT Protocol. All the other required apps and libraries are listed in readme.txt file, for any other questions. Pls, mail me.
To code the NODE-MCU I have used <b>Arduino IDE</b> itself.

The required libraried are: <br>
1.Wire <br>
2.PubSubClient <br>
3.ESP8266WiFi <br>
4.Servo <br>

To setup the MQTT protocol working you need to <b>download</b> MQTTServer and Client Apps from Google Play store. This would allow you to setup a server on your mobile phone and send/recieve instructions through the client app. The project aimed towards simulating various function in a home like <b> Switching, Motion Detection, Opening and Closing Doors.</b>
In V2.0 I would be using a cloud control platform.
Untill then hope you all do contribute back to the project, in case you've found any new improvements. And Pls, do let me know about them, because knowledge is somehting that can be shared. :)
